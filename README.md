Hi there! I’m a 20-year-old developer with a knack for crafting modern, responsive web applications. My toolkit includes ## Next.js ## and ## React ## for dynamic front-end experiences, paired with ## MongoDB ## for robust back-end solutions. I thrive in the full-stack realm, having delivered projects using ## PH P##, ## HTML ##, ## CSS ##, ## JavaScript ##, and even dabbled in ## Python ## for diverse applications.  

##💻 What I Bring to the Table:  ##
- Expertise in end-to-end web development (front-end + back-end).  
- Hands-on experience building projects with modern frameworks and databases.  
- A hunger for clean code, problem-solving, and learning emerging tech.  
- Flexibility to collaborate on freelance gigs, part-time roles, or full-time remote opportunities.
